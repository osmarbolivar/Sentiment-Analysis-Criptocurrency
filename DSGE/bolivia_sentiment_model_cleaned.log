Starting preprocessing of the model file ... 
Found 10 equation(s). 
Evaluating expressions... 
Computing static model derivatives (order 1). 
Normalizing the static model... 
Normalization failed with cutoff, trying symbolic normalization... 
Could not normalize the static model. Variable e_obs is not in the maximum cardinality matching. 
Computing dynamic model derivatives (order 2). 
Normalizing the dynamic model... 
Finding the optimal block decomposition of the dynamic model... 
3 block(s) found: 
  2 recursive block(s) and 1 simultaneous block(s). 
  the largest simultaneous block has 4 equation(s) 
                                 and 4 feedback variable(s). 
Preprocessing completed.
